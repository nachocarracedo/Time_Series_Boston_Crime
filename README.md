## Time_Series_Boston_Crime

This projects goes to different techniques to model Time Series Data in R.

There is an rmarkdown with that takes the reader though all the models. To check the code see the raw markdown.

The objective is to see how each of the models fit the data and how good are they forecasting.

The models I played with are:

* Decomposition models (moving avg and loess) - Regression to the trend.
* Regression
* Holt-Winters (exponential smoothing)
